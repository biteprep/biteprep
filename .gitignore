**Step 1.3: Create a Repository on GitHub**
1.  Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and log in or create an account.
2.  In the top-right corner, click the `+` icon and select **"New repository"**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., `biteprep-project`), leave it as "Public", and **do not** initialize it with a README, license, or .gitignore (we already created our own).
4.  Click **"Create repository"**.
5.  On the next page, GitHub will show you a URL under "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line". It will look like this: `https://github.com/your-username/biteprep-project.git`. **Copy this URL.**

**Step 1.4: Push Your Code**
Now, go back to your terminal, which should be in your project's root directory with the virtual environment activated. Run these commands one by one:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder
git init

# Add all files to be tracked by Git (it will respect the .gitignore file)
git add .

# Make your first "commit" (a snapshot of your code)
git commit -m "Initial commit of BitePrep project"

# Link your local repository to the one you created on GitHub
# Replace the URL with the one you copied from GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/biteprep-project.git

# Push your code from your computer up to GitHub
git push -u origin master
